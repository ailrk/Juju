;;;; it's usually doesn't worth it to use merge sort for small list.
;; The mit algo book says the constant factor makes it not worth it, but
;; I can't find the constant part from the running time analysis.
;; Although the best case for insertion sort is Î¸(n), but we can't rely on
;; the best case.
;; The more convincible explaination is recursive algorihtm needs to allocate
;; extra stack frame, the allocation step makes it slower.
;; Consider a list with size n. For an insertion sort, it either swap
;; it's element or not, it's really constant time. If you use merge sort
;; you need to split the list into two lists with only one input and merge them.
;; that makes it slower.

;; Normally we perform some cut off on merge sort, as when n is smaller then
;; certain threshold we switch to insertion sort to get the best of both world.

;; we need an mutation based insertion sort that can sort any part of a list
