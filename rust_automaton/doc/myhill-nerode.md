# Myhill nerode relation

__[distinguishing extension]__:
given language L, for string x, y if there exists a string z such that xz in L or yz in L.

__[relation L~]__: x L~ y iff there is no distinguishing extensions z.

__[lemma1]__: L is regular iff L~ has finite number of equivalence classes.
__[lemma2]__: number of L~ is the minimal dfa.
__[lemma3]__: minimal dfa is unique.
ps: two string, if there is a distinguishing extension, they are not
    equivalent.
