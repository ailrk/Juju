# System programming with C++

The exact meaning of system programming is very vague. Sometimes it's about networking, sometimes it's about manual memory management, and sometimes ppl use it to refer to embedded programming... it can be anything that doesn't rely on a runtime other then the operating system. Network engineers, compiler engineers, os devs, database guys can all be refered as system programmer, tho they probably know very little about each other's fields, and are more likely to address themselves as what they are a bit more specifically. The word is too board to mean anything substiantial!

I'd rather think it as a list topics of that certain programmers knows. These topics're somehow related with each other, but also dont' connect that tightly that can be classified into one subject. Thus there is a need to have a word to classify so people can talk about them. Some typical system programming items includes: C, C++/Rust, instruction set, operating system structures, compiler optimization, manual memory management.
