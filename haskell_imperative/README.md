# Imperative programming in haskell

This is a little demonstration to recreate things that are common among imperative langauges. They're not necessarily being opereations in IO, because a lot of side effects can actually be simulated with pure funtions.

The most imperative experience might be unrestricted mutation and arbitrary control flow. Mutation is something you get for granted, and usually imperative languages will allow you to break out from a middle of some arbitrary statement.
